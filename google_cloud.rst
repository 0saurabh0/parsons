Google Cloud Storage
====================
Google Cloud Storage is a cloud file storage system. It uses buckets in which to
store arbitary files referred to as blobs.

Authentication utilizes a credentials json file. If you are the adminstrator of your Google Cloud account,
you can generate them in the `Google Cloud Console APIs and Services <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?_ga=2.116342342.-1334320118.1565013288>`_.
